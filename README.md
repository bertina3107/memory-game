# Memory Game
The F1 Memory Game, developed using Python and Pygame, challenges players to match pairs of F1-themed cards. Flip cards to reveal images, test your memory by finding matching pairs, and enjoy a fun, engaging way to enhance cognitive skills with exciting F1 visuals. The person who matches all cards in the shortest amount of time wins.
